# Proposal

## Background and Overview
* My purpose on this project is to showcase my development and design skills and build effects I can use in the future on upcoming projects. I plan to use and master external libraries to create more complex animations and renderings than traditional CSS can offer, while still offering the user the ability to explore and manipulate the effects I create. 

## Functionality and MVPs
- Showcase different animation effects
  - 3D animations
  - User can manipulate certain effects
  - User can interact with certain effects
- Create an interactive menu for the user to navigate through my portfolio of effects
